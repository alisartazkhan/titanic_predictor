# Titanic Survival Prediction with Linear Regression using TensorFlow

This project uses TensorFlow to analyze the Titanic dataset and predict the likelihood of an individual making it to the rescue boat based on various characteristics. 

The program takes in a set of inputs that describe a person's attributes and then uses Linear Regression to make the prediction.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `main()` function. The program will prompt the user to input various characteristics about the passenger for whom they want to make a prediction. Once the user enters the information, the program will output the likelihood of the passenger making it to the rescue boat.

## Required Libraries

The program requires the following libraries to be installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- six
- tensorflow

These libraries can be installed using pip.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main program file containing all the code.
- `TrainingData.csv`: A CSV file containing the Titanic dataset used for training the model.
- `TestData.csv`: A CSV file containing the passenger information for whom the prediction is to be made.

## Future Work

This program can be further improved by using more advanced machine learning models such as neural networks. Additionally, more data can be added to the dataset to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
